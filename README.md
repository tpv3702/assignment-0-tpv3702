# CSE1325-Assignment0

Knowing how to manually compile a program and understand its output is critical as a programmer.
In this introductory assignment, you will verify that you have a working development environment by attempting to compile `Creature.java`.

Begin by attempting to compile the code *as given*.

```
javac Creature.java
```

Observe the error that is output by the compiler. If you do not get any output from this command, you probably don't have JDK installed. Be sure to do that first!

Fix the error listed and attempt to compile it again. Continue this process until the file compiles without ANY warnings or errors.

# Submission

Once you have fixed the code, `commit` your changes and `push` them using `git` commands.
